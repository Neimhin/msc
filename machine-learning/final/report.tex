\subsection{Engineering a ``usage'' feature}
The dublin bike dataset used for this analysis consists
of snapshots of station occupancy at five-minute intervals.
Because of this it is not possible to determin from the
dataset the exact number of times bikes have been
returned to or taken from a station.
We can look at the difference in bike occupancy at the
beginning and end of a five minute interval to establish
a {\em lower-bound} on the number of interactions with
the station, but it is possible for there to have been
more interactions (returns or borrowings) than this difference.
For instance, it may be that a bike station has 10 bikes at time $t$
and 10 bikes at time $t+5\text{m}$, but that in fact 5 bikes were
borrowed and 5 bikes were deposited.

But, we can detect such cases, because the dataset also includes a
\textsc{last updated} field. If the occupancy is not changed, but 
the time of last update is between the start and end of the interval,
then we know that there were at least 2 interactions with the bike station.
