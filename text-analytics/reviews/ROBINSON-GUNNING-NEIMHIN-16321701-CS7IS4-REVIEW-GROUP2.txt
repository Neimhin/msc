G2   STUDENTNUMBER and SURNAME are that of the *reviewer*.
G2   
G2   If the SURNAME is more than one name, insert a hyphen between each.
G2   
G2   These should be aggregated into a zip file and uploaded via Blackboard,

G2   For each question where a scale is used, the intended scale is from 1
G2   to 5, where 5 is the score for the best possible contribution and 1 is
G2   the score for work that is at the opposite end of the spectrum.  For
G2   each category of rating, justify your rating and provide feedback on
G2   how the work could be improved.
G2   
G2   If a question addresses a section of the paper for which the current
G2   draft has no text or only a place-holder section heading, you may
G2   provide the rating "0" and comment accordingly.
G2   
G2   If any item is such that you feel you do not understand it, then use
G2   your comments for the item to indicate how you made sense of the item
G2   and provide a rating and constructive commentary to the authors in
G2   relation of your understanding of the question (noting that if your
G2   understanding of the item makes it identical to another item, then it
G2   is best to apply synonymy avoidance to arrive at a distinct
G2   understanding of the item rather than evaluating the paper with
G2   respect to the same question twice).

G2   TITLE: A Paralinguistic Analysis of Emojis and Emoticons
G2   AUTHORS: Siddhesh Suresh Bangar, Shaunak Pedgaonkar, Eamon Phelan, Parthiban Thandapani, Jiaxuan Xie, Pragati Aboti

G2   1)  Is the title succinct and apt with respect to the essay content?

G2       I feel the authors are engaged in an 'Analysis of Paralinguistics' rather than a 'Paralinguistic Analysis'.
G2       In fact, the word Paralinguistic in the title overpromises since the study is only of emojis and emoticons, not other sorts of paralinguistic expression.
G2   
G2       The title indicates that emojis and emoticons are involved, but gives no clues about what this study contributes relative to other studies of emojis and emoticons.
G2   
G2   2)  Does the abstract accurately and concisely set the context for the
G2     work and indicate the main hypotheses?
G2   
G2   Rating: 3

G2   Comments:
G2   
G2   Hypotheses are not stated clearly, rather approaches and topics of study are mentioned. E.g. the 'syntactic and semantic dimensions' of emojis are mentioned, but no hypotheses about syntactic or semantic dimensions.
G2   
G2   There is a reference to 'semantic coherence', which is not mentioned again in the paper.

G2   5)  Does the research review synthesize a background literature within
G2       a conceptual framework that the authors propose and defend, making
G2       clear how the research questions pursued are left open by prior
G2       literature?

G2       Subsection 2.2 focuses on text similarity. The Jaccard and cosine similarities are mentioned, but there is no discussion of how the vectores used in Jaccard and cosine similarity might be generated. Details on this aspect of the conceptual framework would be beneficial, e.g. is it proposed that vector representations be generated in a supervised or unsupervised fashion?
G2   
G2       Finally, there appears to be no intention on the part of the authors to identify questions about text-similarity analysis left open in the literature, rather they are proposing to use existing analysis methods, which is reasonable.
G2   
G2   
G2   6)  Does the detailed statement of the research question and
G2       hypotheses make clear how the quantities used to measure texts
G2       are adequate as measures of the theoretical constructs
G2       explored?

G2   Subsection 3.1 identifies a supposed gap in the literature in terms of 'large scale algorithmic analysis'. I feel this direction focuses excessively on the method of analysis rather than a substantive question. I think it's appropriate to think of emojis as part of the text, and therefore the proposed question does not seek to relate properties of the texts to qualities and quantities outside the text. For example the research question could have focused on affect, as promised in the introduction, but instead seems to be focused on statistics relating to the distribution of emojis in texts. As such there seem to be no 'theoretical constructs' proposed.
G2   
G2   7) Does the methods section indicate clearly what corpora will be
G2      required for text categories and what sources will be adopted for
G2      any separate categories of information in support of answering the
G2      research questions?

G2       hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors'
G2       hypotheses?

G2       Some of the numbers used in the references are unconventional/unexplained, e.g. e0221297 (Gesselman et al 2019), e0144296 (Kralj et al 2015). These numbers are sometimes mistakenly added in Google Scholar's bibtex export function.

G2       In the abstract it is stated that the "study contributes nuanced insights", which is sort a self-compliment. The discussion of contributions should be more specific, allowing the reader to decide whether there are any nuanced insights.
G2   
G2       In Subseciton 2.3 there is some confusion in the sentence beginning "Text sentiment identification...", where it is perhaps being stated that statistical models `comprehend context'. I think the authors should be careful about such personification of models and algorithms.
G2   
G2       References in the style of 'by Zainuddin and Selamat (2014)' could be simplified to just '(Zainuddin and Selamat 2014)'.
