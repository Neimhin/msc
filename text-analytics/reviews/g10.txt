G10   and provide a rating and constructive commentary to the authors in
G10   relation of your understanding of the question (noting that if your
G10   understanding of the item makes it identical to another item, then it
G10   is best to apply synonymy avoidance to arrive at a distinct

G10   Title: Exploration of the similarity of the music and corresponding lyrics

G10   1)  Is the title succinct and apt with respect to the essay content?

G10   Starting with "Exploration of" is perhaps unneccesary verbosity. One could perhaps say "Similarities between music and corresponding lyrics".
G10   I feel a little more specificity in the title could be beneficial, i.e. 'melodic structure' rather than just 'music'.
G10   Putting 'the' before 'music' in the title reads odd.
G10   
G10   2)  Does the abstract accurately and concisely set the context for the
G10     work and indicate the main hypotheses?
G10

G10   The context is set but the main hypotheses are not indicated.
G10   It is inappropriate to '[try] to prove' a musician maintains similar style across music and lyrics. Rather the goal should be to develop and test hypotheses about the similarity.
G10   
G10   3)  Are the keywords appropriate?

G10   The keyword 'machine learning' is perhaps inappropriate as the paper is doubtful a contribution to machine learning generally, more likely an application of machine learnig for the purpose of text/data analysis.
G10   
G10   4)  Does the essay present clearly the research topic and the research
G10       questions to be pursued within the essay research?
G10

G10   The section "Articulation of Research Question" is confusing to read, due perhaps to typos. It also contains comments about 'persuasiveness' which are not relevant to articulating the research question. The research question remains quite general, 'whether there are certain similarities', and would benefit from a greater degree of specificity. I think the authors would benefit greatly from laying out some specific hypotheses they find interesting about similarities between melodic structure and lyrics texts, e.g. "repetitive melodies are associated with repetitive lyrics", "a larger melodic lexicon is associated with a larger lyrical lexicon".
G10   
G10   5)  Does the research review synthesize a background literature within
G10       a conceptual framework that the authors propose and defend, making
G10       clear how the research questions pursued are left open by prior
G10       literature?

G10   The authors note ABC notation expresses music/melody in a serial fashion, similar to orthography. The study therefore focuses on comparing these two serial formats, i.e. textual formats, which represent/reflect non-textual constructs (music, language).
G10   The authors note several types of vector representations for texts (TF-IDF, word2vec), which can be compared with cosine similarity. What is lacking is a defense of how these vector representations can be used to compare texts across the two domains (music, lyrics).
G10   Some interesting points about approaches to similarity analysis are raised, deriving acoustic features, mining opinions from online forums, colocation of songs in playlists, but these points are not integrated well into the overall discussion, and it is not clear whether or why the authors intend to employ any of these methods.
G10
G10   6)  Does the detailed statement of the research question and
G10       hypotheses make clear how the quantities used to measure texts
G10       are adequate as measures of the theoretical constructs
G10       explored?

G10   The theoretical constructs of interest are not developed clearly. I believe the authors intend to use TF-IDF and cosine similarity of TF-IDF, but have not related this quantity to theoretical constructs, and have not defended the comparison of TF-IDFs derived from ABC texts and Lyrics texts. My understanding is that to compare two TF-IDF vectors, they should be derived from texts with the same domain of possible tokens.
G10   Other quantities I suggest the authors consider are: compression rate (as a proxy for repetitiveness), lexcial diversity, length/verbosity.
G10   
G10   7) Does the methods section indicate clearly what corpora will be
G10      required for text categories and what sources will be adopted for
G10      any separate categories of information in support of answering the
G10      research questions?

G10   For some reason the authors neglect to name the specific artists in their study. Also, since only 40 songs will be analysed, the full list of songs could be supplied inan index.
G10   The dataset described is not clearly linked to specific research questions articulated in the paper.
G10   
G10   8)  Does the description of research methods indicate how the
G10       corpus will be processed in order to assess it according to
G10       the categorization scheme proposed within the essay?

G10   Comments:
G10   Conversion of music from MIDI to ABC notation is mentioned, but the specific conversion tool/algorithm is not mentioned.
G10   Some text preprocessing techniques are mentioned, but are not well motivated with respect to a research question.
G10   
G10   9)  Does the description of research methods indicate how the relevant
G10       quantities and qualities will be measured and assessed,
G10       stipulating what would count as a confirmation of the authors'
G10       hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors'
G10       hypotheses?

G10   A protocol for measurement and assessment of the relevant quantities is not provided in detail, but the authors mention the use of cosine distance, Pearson correlation and Levenshtein distance.
G10   The author's hypotheses are not clearly stated, and therefore there is no account of what would constitute falsification of the hypotheses.

G10   While it seems some of the research methods may be appropriate, the research question is too general, and there is not enough clarity in how the research methods relate to specific questions.

G10       that will be useful to the wider research community?

G10   15) Are tables and figures clearly annotated and captioned?
G10   
G10   Rating: 2
G10   
G10   Comments:
G10   There is one figure which has a title, but not in the typical style, and has no caption. It is also never referenced in text. Also, the term 'flow chart' in the figure title is possibly misleading as flow charts typically containing yes/no questions determinig the direction flow. The provided diagram does not contain such questions.
G10   The authors should place the caption for the figure below the figure, with the number of the figure, and the caption.
G10   "Figure 1: A flowchart detailing the methodology adopted in this study"
G10   It seems the authors are using LaTeX, so they could benefit from using the `\begin{figure} \caption{\label{fig:flowchart}...}\end{figure}` environment.

G10   16) Does the essay present comprehensive bibliographic details for
G10       the printed editions works cited?

G10   Rating: 4
G10   
G10   Comments:
G10   The citation style has some violations, e.g. using parentheses around in-text citations where the author is the subject of the sentence.
G10   The bibliographic details for Berenzweig (2004) and Simonetta (2018), contains et al. in place of the remaining authors.
G10   Chicago style stipulates: "In the bibliography, list up to 10 authors. If there are more than 10, list the first seven followed by “et al.”"
G10   
G10   17) Is the essay well written in a scholarly mode of presentation?
G10   
G10   Rating: 3
G10   
G10   Comments:
G10   Some sections contain way to much detail about things that are irrelevant or at best belong in an appendix.
G10   It is mentioned, for example, that "An average accuracy of 85% was achieved in three rounds ...", but the meaning or relevance of this statement is not clear.
G10   There is little coherence between paragraphs, resulting in a mere sequence of summaries or references, especially in the "Related Works" section.
G10   Some sentences are confusing and need revision, e.g. the first sentence of the "Articulation of Research Question" section.
G10   There are numerous typos and/or grammatical errors, e.g.  "To analysis the similarity".

G10   The description of contributions are reasonably detailed, but at times details background reading rather than the contribution of text/ideas/concepts/figures of relevance.
