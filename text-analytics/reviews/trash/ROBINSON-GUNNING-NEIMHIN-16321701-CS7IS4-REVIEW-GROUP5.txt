1) Is the title succinct and apt with respect to the paper content?
Rating: 3
Comments:
The title does not mention the analysis of dominance, which is a central question
in the paper.

2) Does the abstract accurately and concisely set the context for the
work and indicate the main hypotheses?
Rating: 3
Comments:
Again the abstract fails to mention specific variables of interest;
dominance, introversion, extroversion, conscientiousness.
Hypotheses are not indicated.

3) Are the keywords appropriate?
Rating: 1
Comments:
The keywords seem to be placeholder keywords from a template file.

4) Does the paper present clearly the research topic and the research
questions to be pursued within the paper research?
Rating:
Comments:

5) Does the research review synthesize a background literature within
a conceptual framework that the authors propose and defend, making
clear how the research questions pursued are left open by prior
literature?
Rating:
Comments:

6) Does the research question seek to relate properties of texts
to qualities and quantities outside the texts with reference
to an articulated theory of dependence between them?
Rating:
Comments:

7) Does the methods section indicate clearly what corpora will be
required and what sources will be adopted for the separate
categories in support of answering the research questions?
Rating:
Comments:

8) Does the description of research methods indicate how the
corpus will be processed in order to assess it according to
the categorization scheme proposed within the paper?
Rating:
Comments:

9) Does the description of research methods indicate how the relevant
quantities and qualities will be measured and assessed,
stipulating what would count as a confirmation of the authors’
hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors’
hypotheses?

Comments:

The use of a neural network has not been well-motivated in the text. It's as if the use of a neural network is taken as a given by the authors. In particular, the authors should explain why simpler, more interpretable tools aren't sufficient for their purposes (unless of course simpler tools are sufficient!).

10) Are the research methods appropriate to the question studied?

11) Does the underlying research result in the assembly of a data set
that will be useful to the wider research community?
Rating:
Comments:

12) Are results clearly provided?
Rating:
Comments:

13) Does the discussion of results provide a clear interpretation,
with reference to the research questions posed?
Rating:
Comments:

14) Do the conclusions emphasize how the interpreted results
contribute to the literature?
Rating:
Comments:

15) Are tables and figures clearly annotated and captioned?
Rating:
Comments:

16) Does the paper present comprehensive bibliographic details for
works cited?
Rating:
Comments:

Many of the references fail to adhere to the Chicago style:
e.g. (Koutsombogera Vogel, 2018) should be (Koutsombogera and Vogel, 2018)
e.g. it is not clear what (Koutsombogera, Costello, Vogel) is referring to.
e.g. it is not clear what (Koutsombogera, Sarthy, Vogel) is referring to.


17) Is the paper well written in a scholarly mode of presentation?
Rating:
Comments:

Some of the language used is overly congratulatory or praising, rather than having an objective/descriptive style.
e.g. "The corpus is intended to enhance..." could be replaced with a more objective description of the MULTISIMO dataset, or to make the point could be replaced with an example of how the dataset has enhanced understanding.
e.g. rather than saying "a careful examination" it would be better to demonstrate the research team's care and rigor, through precision, attention to detail, etc.

Some examples of typos/unfinished sentences:
e.g. "in successive dialoge segments was positively correlation"

The style could benefit from modesty in some sections:
e.g. "The outcome of this research is intended to have a deep impact"

18) Does the description of individual contributions suggest an
equitable division of labour?
Rating:
Comments:

19) Does the description of individual contributions provide
sufficiently rich description of the individual contributions in
a manner that allows an independent reader to assess who
contributed what and in a fashion that justifies any percentage
estimates of work?
Rating: 2
Comments:

The declaration of contributions lacks details of the specific contributions of each group member.
