Title: Exploration of the similarity of the music and corresponding lyrics 
Authors:  Yuanpei Teng, Peichen Sun, Hasha Vardhan Gajendar Kumar, Haokun Zhang, Jiawei Shen, Barath Nithish Lingasamy
1) Is the title succinct and apt with respect to the paper content?
Rating: 3
Comments:
Starting with "Exploration of" is perhaps unneccesary verbosity. One could perhaps say "Similarities between music and corresponding lyrics.
I feel a little more specificity in the title could be beneficial, i.e. 'melodic structure' rather than just 'music'.
Putting 'the' before 'music' in the title reads odd.

2) Does the abstract accurately and concisely set the context for the
work and indicate the main hypotheses?
Rating: 3
Comments:
The context is set but the main hypotheses are not indicated.
It is inappropriate to '[try] to prove' a musician maintains similar style across music and lyrics. Rather the goal should be to develop and test hypotheses about the similarity.

3) Are the keywords appropriate?
Rating: 4
Comments:
The keyword 'machine learning' is perhaps inappropriate as the paper is doubtful a contribution to machine learning generally, more likely an application of machine learnig for the purpose of text/data analysis.

4) Does the paper present clearly the research topic and the research
questions to be pursued within the paper research?
Rating: 2
Comments:
The section "Articulation of Research Question" is confusing to read, due perhaps to typos. It also contains comments about 'persuasiveness' which are not relevant to articulating the research question. The research question remains quite general, 'whether there are certain similarities', and would benefit from a greater degree of specificity. I think the authors would benefit greatly from laying out some specific hypotheses they find interesting about similarities between melodic structure and lyrics texts, e.g. "repetitive melodies are associated with repetitive lyrics", "a larger melodic lexicon is associated with a larger lyrical lexicon".

5) Does the research review synthesize a background literature within
a conceptual framework that the authors propose and defend, making
clear how the research questions pursued are left open by prior
literature?

Comments:
The authors note ABC notation expresses music/melody in a serial fashion, similar to orthography. The study therefore focuses on comparing these two serial formats, i.e. textual formats, which represent/reflect non-textual constructs (music, language).
The authors note several types of vector representations for texts (TF-IDF, word2vec), which can be compared with cosine similarity. What is lacking is a defense of how these vector representations can be used to compare texts across the two domains (music, lyrics).
Some interesting points about approaches to similarity analysis are raised, deriving acoustic features, mining opinions from online forums, colocation of songs in playlists, but these points are not integrated well into the overall discussion, and it is not clear whether or why the authors intend to employ any of these methods.

6) Does the research question seek to relate properties of texts
to qualities and quantities outside the texts with reference
to an articulated theory of dependence between them?

7) Does the methods section indicate clearly what corpora will be
required and what sources will be adopted for the separate
categories in support of answering the research questions?

8) Does the description of research methods indicate how the
corpus will be processed in order to assess it according to
the categorization scheme proposed within the paper?

9) Does the description of research methods indicate how the relevant
quantities and qualities will be measured and assessed,
stipulating what would count as a confirmation of the authors’
hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors’
hypotheses?
