G5    6) Does the research question seek to relate properties of texts
G5    to qualities and quantities outside the texts with reference
G5    to an articulated theory of dependence between them?

G5    9) Does the description of research methods indicate how the relevant
G5    quantities and qualities will be measured and assessed,
G5    stipulating what would count as a confirmation of the authors’
G5    hypotheses and what would count as falsification of the authors’
G5    hypotheses?

G5    The use of a neural network has not been well-motivated in the text. It's as if the use of a neural network is taken as a given by the authors. In particular, the authors should explain why simpler, more interpretable tools aren't sufficient for their purposes (unless of course simpler tools are sufficient!).

G5    Many of the references fail to adhere to the Chicago style:
G5    e.g. (Koutsombogera Vogel, 2018) should be (Koutsombogera and Vogel, 2018)
G5    e.g. it is not clear what (Koutsombogera, Costello, Vogel) is referring to.

G5    Some of the language used is overly congratulatory or praising, rather than having an objective/descriptive style.
G5    e.g. "The corpus is intended to enhance..." could be replaced with a more objective description of the MULTISIMO dataset, or to make the point could be replaced with an example of how the dataset has enhanced understanding.
G5    e.g. rather than saying "a careful examination" it would be better to demonstrate the research team's care and rigor, through precision, attention to detail, etc.
G5    
G5    Some examples of typos/unfinished sentences:
G5    e.g. "in successive dialoge segments was positively correlation"
G5    
G5    The style could benefit from modesty in some sections:
G5    e.g. "The outcome of this research is intended to have a deep impact"

G5    18) Does the description of individual contributions suggest an
G5    equitable division of labour?

G5    19) Does the description of individual contributions provide
G5    sufficiently rich description of the individual contributions in
G5    a manner that allows an independent reader to assess who
G5    contributed what and in a fashion that justifies any percentage
G5    estimates of work?

G5    The declaration of contributions lacks details of the specific contributions of each group member.
