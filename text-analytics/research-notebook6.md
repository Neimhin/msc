### Research Topic
I drafted the Research Questions section of our mid-term paper.
We have two main research questions,
both of which are guided by the desire to extract useful tips and guidance for
engaging in constructive advice-seeking and advice-giving.
We continue to consider a third research question around
the potential therapeutic benefit of engagement with r/AmItheAsshole.
This third research question could be addressed in a manner very similar to Seraj et al.'s (2021) work
on Reddit break-up divulgences.

### Summary of "Efficient Estimation of Word Representations in Vector Space"
Author: Mikolov
Year: 2013
Estimation of semantically and structurally informative vector representations of words has seen
progress due to the capacity of neural network based models to process huge datasets in tractable times, as well as due to the trend of generating high dimensional (e.g. >200) vector representations. \cite{mikolov-2013} exemplifies this approach, and shows
that vector representations learned from unsupervised data can
express semantic and structural relationships between words
in intuitive algebraic relationships.
The cosine similarity of vector representations can be leveraged to
develop programs that automatically
extract nuanced semantic analyses of texts.
