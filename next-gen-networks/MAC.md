Medium Access Control

| Media/Topology | MAC Mechanism      | Description                                                                                      |

| Ethernet       | CSMA/CD            | Devices listen while transmitting and can detect collisions. If a collision is detected, devices stop, wait, and then try again. Used in older Ethernet technologies. |
| Wi-Fi          | CSMA/CA            | Devices listen before transmitting. If the channel seems busy, they'll defer their transmission and wait a random amount of time before retrying. |
| Cellular       | TDMA, FDMA, CDMA   | Depending on the generation of cellular technology: TDMA divides channel into time slots, FDMA divides it into frequency bands, and CDMA uses unique codes for each device. |
| Token Ring     | Token Passing      | Devices need possession of a token to transmit. The token is passed sequentially between devices. This ensures only one device transmits at a time. |
| Satellite      | TDMA, FDMA         | TDMA allows multiple earth stations or satellite transponders to share the same frequency by dividing signals into different time slots. FDMA assigns each earth station a unique frequency channel. |
| Bluetooth      | FHSS, TDD          | Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) divides the frequency band into channels and devices hop between them. Time Division Duplexing (TDD) allows devices to transmit and receive in the same frequency by switching between them in time. |
