8. Which is false?
	1. in a coherent transmission, modulation can be acrried out through direct modulation of the laser source. FALSE
	2. a signal needs to be modulated in order to transmit information. TRUE
	3. amplitude modulated signals carry less information than coherent signals, for the same bandwidth occupation. TRUE
	4. a coherent receiver does not need dispersion compensating fibre even for long transmission distances. TRUE, all done in DSP now
In a coherent transmission you use 2 or 4 channels. Direct modulation can only turn on/off one laser, but need to split the coherent light and add $90^o$ phase to a channel, then modulate the different channels. Direct modulation would modulate all the channels the same.
9. Which is false?
	1. Optical signal to noise ratio plays a fundamental role in amplified link design. TRUE
	2. For a given span length, optical signal to noise ratio limits the number of amplifiers that can be cascaded in a link. TRUE
	3. A regenerator is used in long links to eliminate all bit errors up to that point in the link. FALSE
	4. A flex-grid transmission system allows to accommodate signals of different baud rates and modulation formats. TRUE
10. Which is false?
	1. VDSL2 with vectoring is the technology that achieves highest capacity in copper transmission in copper. FALSE e.g. XG.FAST
