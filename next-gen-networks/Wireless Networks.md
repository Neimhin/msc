### Coherence Time
**Coherence Time in Mobile Telecommunications**: In mobile telecommunications, coherence time represents the time period during which the wireless channel conditions (e.g., channel gains, delays, phase shifts) remain relatively constant or predictable as a mobile device moves. It is influenced by factors such as the velocity of the mobile device, the carrier frequency, and the environment (e.g., urban or rural).
Relative motion of the transmitter and receiver can introduce Doppler shifts in the received signal. Doppler shifts cause frequency and phase changes.
The environment influences how much multi-path interference occurs, which can affect coherence time. If the environment is changing constantly (moving vehicle, trains, elevators, people) then the channel will change and coherence may be lost.
