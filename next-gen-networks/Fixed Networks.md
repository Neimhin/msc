## Introduction
Connecting each access ISP to every other access ISP doesn't scale; $O(n^2)$. Solution: hierarchy of providers at different scales.

Content provider networks (e.g. Google, Microsoft, Azure) are at similar scales to Tier 1 ISPs, and so have great leverage.

## Optical Propagation
- total internal reflection
- path loss: ~0.2 dB/km\
- up to 150km without amplification

### Optical Transmitters and Receivers
- LASER: Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation
	- generate **coherent light**

### ROADMs
OADM = Optical Add/Drop Multiplexer, a type of Wave Division Multiplexing
ROADM = Reconfigurable OADM
