Q5 answer? ChatGPT says 802.11a, but 802.11g uses lower bandwidth, better coverage?
### Wireless Networks
1.  Which of the following statements is incorrect?
    1.  High velocity of transmitters corresponds to low coherence time. TRUE!
    2.  Significant multipath corresponds to low coherence bandwidth. TRUE!
    3.  A completely static environment corresponds to an infinite coherence time. TRUE!
    4.  We can more easily deploy multiple antennas on a mobile phone at lower carrier frequencies. FALSE!
2.  Which of the following design choices is best in terms of energy efficiency in a Frequency Division Duplexing (FDD) system?
    1.  Uplink frequency should be higher than downlink frequency
    2.  Uplink frequency should be lower than downlink frequency. TRUE, better coverage per watt
    3.  Uplink frequency should the same as downlink frequency
    4.  The choice of uplink and downlink frequency is not relevant for energy efficiency
3.  Which one among the following options cannot be consider a “knob” in the cognitive radio sense?
    1.  Number of selected transmit antennas
    2.  Modulation technique
    3.  Medium access control protocol
    4.  All the above are possible knobs
4.  Which of the following statements is incorrect in a single link system?
    1.  Increasing the bandwidth is never detrimental to the data rate
    2. In a spatial multiplexing system, the data rate increases linearly with the number of transmit or receive antenna.
    3.  The multi-user interference will lead to a decrease in the data rate.
    4.  The usage of frequency reuse is not relevant.
5.  In case you want to optimise both data rate and coverage, which of the following options is the best design choice?
    1.  802.11g (Wi-Fi 3, 2003)
    2.  802.11a (Wi-Fi 3, 1999)
    3.  802.11b (Wi-Fi 2, 1999)
    4.  802.11 (Wi-Fi 1, 1997)
### Fixed Networks
6.  In which of the following cases increasing network margins is not useful:
    1.  When the specification of active network components is not known
    2.  When there is possible estimation error in the fibre length of the spans
    3.  When the network is running at maximum possible capacity
    4.  When the amount of crosstalk introduced by ROADMs is under estimated
7.  Which of the following statements is true with regards to capacity in optical fibre:
    1.  higher order modulation format requires higher signal to noise ratio
    2.  Increasing the transmission power always increases capacity
    3.  high dispersion coefficient in fibre leads to higher capacity
    4.  Amplifiers with higher noise figures lead to higher capacity
8.  Which of the following is not an advantage of a coherent system over a direct detection:
    1.  It can provide higher data rates. TRUE
    2.  It does not require the use of dispersion compensating fibre. NOT AN ADVANTAGE
    3.  It can work with lower input power. NOT AN ADVANTAGE
    4.  It is simpler to build. NOT AN ADVANTAGE
9.  In a chain of optical amplifiers:
    1.  The optical signal to noise ratio is independent on the number of amplifiers
    2.  Optical amplifiers are typically used for multi-mode fibres
    3.  The amplifiers provide digital regeneration of the signals
    4.  The optical signal to noise ratio depends on the span length
10.  Which of the following statements is false about the Shannon-Hartley theorem?
    1.  Capacity is directly proportional to bandwidth (true!)
    2.  Capacity is directly proportional to signal to noise ratio (false!)
    3.  Higher loss implies lower signal to noise ratio in copper medium (true!)
    4.  Capacity stays the same if signal and noise increase by the same factor. (true!)
