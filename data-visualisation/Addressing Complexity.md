Avoiding distortion **and** distraction.

What do we do when the data is visually too complex but we still need to present it in a limited amount of space and time?
Avoid superfluous visualisation, superfluidity.
Reduce clutter, use references, guides, legends, labels etc., but avoid cluttering with these.
Distinguish-ability and range.

Distribute the processing task between visual and serial cognition.

Simplicity is a key goal in vis. design.

Data to ink ratio = $\frac{\text{ink used specifically to depict data}}{\text{total ink used on graphic}}$ = ideally as close as possible to 1

Textures (rather than colours) considered to occupy too much visual processing, too distracting, cluttered. Avoid textures if possible.
**but** can overlay texture with other textures, overlay texture with colour etc.


High data/ink ratio: continuous signals, brain waves.

Clutter, chart-junk, superfluous grid lines, tick marks, etc.

Distortion, zooming in by mouse position, fish eye lens, simple box zoom, can be useful for interactivity or apply focus/context.

Change granularity on zoom, e.g. number of place names on google maps.

### Static vs Dynamic approaches (dashboards)
animation (one after the other) vs parallelism (collage of images)

change blindness, can't see big differences if two images are spaced out

distractors flashing can cause change blindness
