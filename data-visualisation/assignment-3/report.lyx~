\begin_layout Subsection
New York City Weather in 1980 by Edward Tufte
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tufte's weather chart consists of three main subplots.
 The bottom subplot shows relative humidity as of noon as a percentage,
 which is a variable, presumably consisting of 365 samples in the dataset.
 The day of the year 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,...,365$
\end_inset

 is encoded with x-position, and the precipitation percentage with y-position.
 There are vertical gridlines indicating the start of each month, and horizontal
 gridlines for the quartiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The middle subplot presents the total precipitation for each month in comparison
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for that month.
 This is a continuous variable measured in inches, and is encoded as the
 length of the bar in the bar charts (equivalently the area of the bar is
 proportional to the preciptation).
 The categories 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are encoded in two ways, texture and position.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 1980 preciptation is represented with solid black bars positioned to the
 left of the respective 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 precipitation, whose texture is diagonal hatching.
 The total precipitation for 1980 is presented textually along with the
 normal for the whole year.
 The month in question is encoded by position.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top subplot presents temperature data.
 There are three time-series line plots, one for the actual temperature,
 one for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 low temperature for a given day of the year, and another for the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

Visualization Design

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset I have chosen consists of captured network packets in an Internet
 of Things (IoT) laboratory.
 The dataset is called CICIoT2023 (TODO CITE) and was created by simulating
 various kinds of cyber attacks on IoT devices using other IoT devices.
 The dataset is available in two forms; firstly the raw packet capture (
\begin_inset ERT

\end_layout

\end_inset

) data for each type of cyber attacks as well as for simulated benign traffic;
 secondly an engineered subset of the data in 
\begin_inset ERT

 format which was designed specifically to be used for training machine
 learning models to detect cyber attacks.
\end_layout
