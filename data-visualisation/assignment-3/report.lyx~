\begin_layout Subsection
New York City Weather in 1980 by Edward Tufte
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Tufte's weather chart visualizes humidity, precipitation, and temperature
 data for the year 1980 in comparison with averages.
 The bottom subplot shows relative humidity as of noon as a percentage,
 which is a variable, presumably consisting of 365 samples in the dataset.
 The day of the year 
\begin_inset Formula $1,2,...,365$
\end_inset

 is encoded with x-position, and the precipitation percentage with y-position.
 There are vertical gridlines indicating the start of each month, and horizontal
 gridlines for the quartiles.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The middle subplot presents the total precipitation for each month in comparison
 to the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for that month.
 This is a continuous variable measured in inches, and is encoded as the
 length of the bar in the bar charts (equivalently the area of the bar is
 proportional to the preciptation).
 The categories 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 are encoded in two ways, texture and position, with 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

actual
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 1980 preciptation in solid black bars on the left and 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 precipitation with diagonal hatching on the right.
 The total precipitation for 1980 is presented textually along with the
 normal for the whole year.
 There are twelve groupings, one for each month, from left to right in chronolog
ical order.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The top subplot presents temperature in three time-series line plots, actual
 high and low temperatures for each day, and a line each for normal low
 and normal high.
 A small subplot is embedded showing the 1980 and normal annual temperatures
 using the same encodings as the precipitation bar charts.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some of the tasks that Tufte's vis.
 facilitates are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compare 1980 precipitation/temperatures to nomal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compare temperatures/precipitation of each month to each other month in
 1980 and normally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
identify warmest, coolest, most humid, most rainy months in 1980 and normally
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
identify outlier temperatures, precipitation rates
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
identify periodicity or lack thereof in temperature and humidity
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of 12 bar charts to compare precipitation incurs a low data-to-ink
 ratio.
 However the shape of the bars is reminiscent of a bucket, e.g.
 full of rainy, which is appropriate in context.
 Each bar could be replace with a single dot or line to offer the same accuracy,
 but I think the bar offers easier comparison between distant months, e.g.
 March and November.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The high and low temperature lines lack an encoding channel and are instead
 indicated with text boxes and rely on the assumption of continuity.
 I think encoding the high/low category with hue, e.g.
 a warm color for high and cool color for low, would have made it more intuitive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are several issues in terms of clarity and terminology.
 I assume that 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means arithmetic mean over all years.
 Because 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

normal
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 has a specific meaning in statistics I think it is an unfortunate choice.
 The 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

annual temperature
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 presumably means some sort of average for the year, but the specific meaning
 is not supplied.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The black line indicating the time-series of temperature has a strangely
 inconsistent thickness.
 From researching around I believe that each day may have been plotted as
 a vertical line from that day's low to its high, but this is not explained
 or made clear in the visualization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The figure has text indicators of the lowest low and the highest high, but
 it would also be kind to the reader to show the highest low and lowest
 high, since this can not easily be identified visually.

Music, Google and books by Federica Fragapane

\series bold
datasets and data:
\series default
 For each of the 40 artists in the vis.
 there is a single corresponding country which was most interested in that
 artist according to Google Trends between 2012 and 2017.
 Artists are sorted left to right by rank order release of their first studio
 album, and top to bottom by rank order number of studio albums.
 The number of biografies written about the artist is encoded as balloon
 size, and the continent of the country most interested in the artist by
 hue.
 For each country, the height of a Gaussian curve represents the count of
 artists in whom that country showed the highest interest.
 Each country is connected by curved line to the countries in whom it showed
 most interest.
 The countries are grouped by continent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
tasks:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compare number of biografies, number of studio albums, release of debut
 album
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
identify countries/continents particularly enthusiastic about popular music
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This light-hearted visualization is spacious and conservative in the use
 of dark colors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The country associated with each artist is a categorical variable, but there
 are 40 categories which is a range that can't be captured easily by the
 channels shape, hue, texture, which are typically suitable to categorisation.
 I think in this case in was appropriate to use connection lines to indicate
 the country because of the large number of countries.
 These connection lines do add some chaos and substantial ink to the visualizati
on while only conveying a single data-point, and there is significant serial
 cognitive overhead in linking countries to artists, but the lighthearted
 style of the vis encourages you to play the game of tracing the lines back
 to the country.

Growing Family, by Nathan Yau
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This vis.
 presents the timelines of womens' childbearing.
 The vis.
 changes over time as more women's timelines are iteratively added to the
 chart.
 Considering the static axes, x-position encodes the age (in years) of the
 mother at the birth of a child, and y-position, descending, encodes the
 number of children the mother has.
 Green circles are used to accumulate the number of women who had a given
 number of children at a given age, where the size of the relative size
 of the circle reflects the number of women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The timelines of individual women are animated as a black dot which moves
 from left to right at linear speed as time progress, but which moves down
 to indicate a year in which a women had a child.
 A purple line traces the route of the black dot and fades away after the
 black dot vanishes.
 Several timelines are being animated at any given time.
 It's not easy to establish how the vis.
 handles the birth of twins, triplets etc.

Visualization Design

\begin_layout Standard
The dataset I have chosen consists of captured network packets in an Internet
 of Things (IoT) laboratory.
 The dataset is called CICIoT2023 (TODO CITE) and was created by simulating
 various kinds of cyber attacks on IoT devices using other IoT devices.
 The dataset is available in two forms; firstly the raw packet capture (
\begin_inset ERT

) data for each type of cyber attacks as well as for simulated benign traffic;
 secondly an engineered subset of the data in 
\begin_inset ERT

\end_inset

 format which was designed specifically to be used for training machine
 learning models to detect cyber attacks.
