 ...33 attacks in an IoT topology composed of 105 devices...
#### paper:
The authors construct a dataset comprising several types of cyber attacks on an IoT network carried out by other IoT devices. The data were generated using the CIC IoT Lab, which is a laboratory network consisting of 105 real IoT devices of various types, connected in a topology outlined in REF PAPER.
The dataset is available in two formats, pcap (packet captures, the original format), and csv (human readable).
```shell
$ cat part-00* | grep MITM | wc -l
307593
```
