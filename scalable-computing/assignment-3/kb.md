Paper: The quantitative theory of information. P. Harremoës, F. Topsøe 2008
https://ir.cwi.nl/pub/13851/13851B.pdf
We have spent considerable time considering specific technical aspects of the scaling and scalability of data and systems.

In the previous two exercises you focused on narrow technical aspects and
lessons from the different papers you all reviewed.
For exercise three, the focus will be somewhat different – you will go back in time and all review a single paper that is considered by some to be one of the more accessible and integrational works in the conceptual information theory domain. It was published in 2008 in a “Handbook on the
Philosophy of Information”(!), and touches on many of the key notions and approaches that we still work with and employ today.
As with the previous exercises, you should
i) summarise your key technical take-aways, **and** your key learnings on a single side of A4
paper (11pt font).
I’d then like each of you to take any **one** of the key domains and concepts addressed in the paper and, on a second single side of A4 paper,
ii) document your insights and thinking as to how and where this **one** area has moved to
today, AND
iii) document your insights and thinking as to how and where this **one** area will have
moved to in five (5) years time.
You will need to do some research and identify your own authoritative papers and literature
sources for parts ii and iii). Please remember that your focus should not overly drift from the
information theory/capacity at scale aspect of the activity.
